# CO2 Emission of Cars

This project is to predict the emission of CO2 from different cars having different configurations like:

  - Type of the Car
  - Engine Size
  - Type of Fuel
  - Car Class
  - Cylinders Size
  - Fuel Consumed in the City
  - Fuel Consumed on the Highway
  - Car's MPG
 
 
Inorder to predict the emission of CO2, the algorithm used is "Multi-Linear Regression"

A Flask application is integrated with the build model. So that the user can enter the inputs through the UI of the application.


This is the Home page of the UI

By clicking on the "Prediction" button the user will be redirected to the following page

Here, the user can give the details of the car. By clicking on the "Predict" button the emission of CO2 for that particular vehicle will be predicted.

(Sample inputs given by the user)
